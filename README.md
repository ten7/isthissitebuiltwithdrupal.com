# Is This Site Built With Drupal?
Hello, there 👋🏻 If you've been here before, welcome back.

In early March 2023, [Joe Shindelar](https://www.drupal.org/u/eojthebrave) graciously transferred this domain over to [Ivan Stegic](https://ten7.com/about/team/ivan-stegic) and [TEN7](https://ten7.com/) after he decided to let it expire. The plan (as of March 2023) is to get the old site up and running again as soon as possible.

If you'd like to know when we're back, send an email to [isitdrupal@ten7.com](mailto:isitdrupal@ten7.com) and we'll keep you posted.
